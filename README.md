Bio
🧠 I lead a team of AI scientists at Amazon Alexa to find innovative ways to advance the field of Speaker Recognition and Personalization.

⌛️ Previously, I was part of the Machine Intelligence Neural Design (MIND) team at Apple, where I specialized in designing AI models for a wide range of applications including Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, and Computer Vision. Prior to that, I was one of the early architects of Apple's M1 chip, which involved developing models for estimating performance of future Macs years in advance, and driving debugs to narrow down and fix performance bottlenecks. Before Apple, I spent a couple of years at Nvidia and Qualcomm working on GPUs and ML Accelerators.

🌱 I'm currently pursuing my graduate studies part-time in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from Stanford University.

🎓 I received my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in Computer Architecture from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and graduated in 2014 with an outstanding graduate student award.
